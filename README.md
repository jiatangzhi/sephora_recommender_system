# ðŸ’„ Sephora Recommender System

A data-driven project to explore and build a personalized beauty product recommender system using user reviews and product metadata from Sephora.

## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The first stage of the project focuses on understanding the data, user behavior, and product characteristics. Key highlights include:

- Distribution of product ratings and recommendation patterns
- Group differences by skin type, skin tone, and hair color
- Correlation between variables such as loves count, price, and helpfulness
- Cleaned and preprocessed product & review datasets
- Visual insights using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

_Notebooks:_
- `sephora_eda.ipynb`

## ðŸ§  Recommender System (WIP)

Built a recommendation engine using techniques such as:

- **Content-Based Filtering**  by product type, category, skin type compatibility
- **Collaborative Filtering** based on user reviews or ratings
- **Hybrid Approaches** a combination of both for better personalization

Planned deployment using **Streamlit**.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack

- Languages & Libraries: Python, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib.
