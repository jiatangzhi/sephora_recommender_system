# ðŸ’„ Sephora Recommender System

A personalized beauty product recommender system powered by product metadata and user reviews from Sephora. Built with a focus on both user experience and data-driven insights.

## ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The first phase of the project dives into the Sephora dataset to uncover user behaviors and product patterns. Highlights include:

- Distribution of ratings and recommendation trends
- Group analysis by skin type, tone, and hair color
- Correlation between loves count, price, and helpfulness
- Cleaned & preprocessed datasets for products and reviews
- Visualizations with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`

## ðŸ§  Recommender System

The recommendation engine leverages multiple approaches:

- **Content-Based Filtering**: by category, skin type compatibility, etc.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: based on user review patterns
- **Hybrid Approach**: combines both for improved personalization

The full UI is built using **Streamlit**, with a clean and aesthetic design tailored for beauty-focused users.

## ðŸ§ª Model Evaluation & Fine-Tuning

Planned:
- Evaluate with precision, recall, etc.
- Compare models using A/B testing
- Optimize similarity measures and filtering thresholds

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- **Python** (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Streamlit** for frontend UI
